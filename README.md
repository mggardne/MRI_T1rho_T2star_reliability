# MRI_T1rho_T2star_reliability
A collection of Matlab M-files for reading Philips DICOM MRI T1rho and T2star knee image data, registering the spin lock or echo times using Melastix and elastix, reading OsiriX segmentation CSV files and calculating T1rho or T2star for regions of interest based on tibiofemoral contact.

Please see ImageAnalysisPipeline6.pdf for a flowchart for the sequence of execution of Matlab M-files.

Please see the header comments in the M-files.
